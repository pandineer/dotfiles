# dotfiles

dotfiles for me.

# How to use

Please run install.sh.  
install.sh creates symbolic links to dotfiles and directories, from HOME to here.  
If the same name file exists already, you will be asked to overwrite it or not.  
If the same name directory exists already, "Please remove or rename it" message is shown, and you will be asked to continue or not.
